# Overview
This horizontal bar chart visual can be used as a filter to slice through your data in a more meaningful fashion while saving space by putting the category labels inside the bars itself. You can add different tooltips to show next level of detail that you donâ€™t want visible right on the first look but still is relevant to the dataset.
